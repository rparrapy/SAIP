# Apache configuration File for saip
# Read README.txt
# This should be added to your apache config folder.
# If you are mounting your app as a site wide you can rename the file
# to something like `002-saip`
# and put anything else that you want to be available in 001-someapp;
# When done editing this file copy to apache config folder.
# On Debian copy to /etc/apache2/sites-available/
#    cp ./apache/saip /etc/apache2/sites-available/saip
#    a2ensite saip

# Your TurboGears project needs to be installed at::
#    /usr/local/turbogears/saip
# So that this file is present::
#    /usr/local/turbogears/saip/production.ini
# You can reconfigure this with::
#    paster modwsgi_deploy --deployment=somedir
# This folder should be outside of apache's "file" location.
# Your package should not be installed into python site-package.
